The age of Artificial Intelligence began with the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. Since then, generative Artificial Intelligence (denoted gAI below) has advanced in ways few could have imagine just a few years earlier. Yet, as this technology expands, its energy dependence has revealed a profound environmental cost. The massive data centers that power gAI consume vast amounts of electricity and water, contributing to carbon emissions and resource depletion. In a world already facing severe ecological distress, this unchecked growth presents another push toward environmental collapse. In this project, I aim to define the method and severity of the environmental impact of gAI, identify the people, their disparities, and regions most affected, and propose informed, sustainable solutions. Although gAI is here to stay, immediate global and legislative initiatives must be taken to reduce its damage and ensure a livable future. I plan to merge my skills in art and computer science by creating a website and/or animated visual piece that illustrates the cause, effect, and potential solutions to gAI’s environmental footprint. As both a computer scientist and an artist, I view this topic as both hopeful and conflicting—gAI enhances creativity and innovation while threatening the stability of the environment and creative employment. I recognize gAI’s immense potential to enhance creativity and productivity across disciplines, yet I am equally aware of its threat to both creative employment and environmental stability. I frame this issue using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. Before addressing higher-level concerns such as job security or creative identity, we must first protect the most basic human need: a livable planet. Environmental preservation underpins every other form of progress. Therefore, this project is not only an academic pursuit, but also an ethical one: an effort to understand and advocate for sustainable AI development before its benefits can no longer be enjoyed. I aim to inform, visualize, and inspire: By merging my technical and artistic abilities, I hope to create a compelling, research-based project that encourages awareness, responsibility, and collaboration toward a sustainable technological future. i want to create a visual for this, using computer graphics in an abstract, animated nature. I want to visualize the long term effects of ai impact on the environment via some kind of visual, such as a fish losing or gaining its scales, changing color, etc. etc. I also want to use computer graphics to visualize it in a 3d way, allowing users to spin the fish and see specific areas where it falls or grains. I want to have it look like its moving, very slowly over time, in an environment of water, and the scales slowly drift away and disintegrate. Users should be able to click a scale to see an aspect that may be impacted, denoted as it glows when hovered over. I want there to be lines and almost a "blueprint" sort of gridding over certain parts such that it gives that technological feel. Additionally, I want to use a beta fish to emphasize that we are one, just one fish in the sea, and our enviornment, the earth, is all we have. The beta, perhaps a moon or plakat, will begin with strong, reflective blue and green, rainbow tones, but will shed and fade into dark rainbow greys (muted colors). I have to emphasize the whispy, water like physics and flow on the fish, constantly moving, clean water, with light eminating from the top. But over time, the water should get greyer, muddy, and tiny particles that give the feeling of congested, bleak. (sketch included of base) What AIs can i use to achieve this and what premade assets can i use, like https://codepen.io/n_c_/pen/eYmyWON (but more complex for the background) https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/animals/fish/betta-splendens-c448a4e4-b28e-4b6c-b0d8-7bad791ed05c (preferably free) https://tympanus.net/Development/AmbientCanvasBackgrounds/index2.html (water particles?) https://codepen.io/sacsam005/pen/BaJmaXy (alt water particles) https://codepen.io/Yakudoo/pen/BNNGBq (this logic, fish follows cursor maybe?) https://codepen.io/Adir-SL/pen/LYEPzxW (swimming logic and shadow) https://codepen.io/aptorres27/pen/mPGZPp (constellation grid, interactible with cursor) https://codepen.io/Tibixx/pen/OJgNWdv (numbers with constellations) https://codepen.io/atzedent/pen/bGXLGBw (this for water stream direction but horizontal) these are just suggestions, and may not be beneficial, but i just want to start the ball rolling cuz i have like 12 hours for this
